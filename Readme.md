valetudo-helper-miio is a small utility that can execute raw miio commands, which can be useful e.g., during development.

It comes as a single binary with no additional dependencies and requires only experience with a terminal.

Simply download the latest binary [from the releases section](https://github.com/Hypfer/valetudo-helper-miio/releases)
and execute it in a terminal/powershell window.



## Valetudo helpers

Valetudo helpers are a series of small standalone self-contained single-purpose single-file tools built to make
usage and/or installation of Valetudo a bit easier.

As with everything Valetudo, some intermediate computer skills are required. You should know what a network is,
what HTTP is, how a terminal works and that kind of stuff.
Please understand that it's not feasible for this or any open source project to provide basic computer lessons.
